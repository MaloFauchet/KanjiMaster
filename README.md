# KanjiMaster
KanjiMaster is a project made in order to help me learn japanese.
Indeed this project is a quiz where you either have : 
- A kanji (japanese symbol) and four traduction possibilities
- A traduction and you have to choose between four kanjis.

This project has an ui wich is made with customtkinter.
It uses a database and sqlite3 in order to store and pick all the different kanjis with their traductions
You can choose between (for now) two types of "kanjis" : The basics or the polite ones (cf. https://kakikukeko.fr/)

I'd now like to add some features as:
- Create a user-friendly way to add questions to the date base
- Add sounds, musics, to make the app more entertaining
